    Every ``timeout`` handed to the gateway was measured on an idle host, and
    on a loaded one measured the host instead: the MLX probe (56.6s of wall
    on 16.6s of CPU), a boot's ``git symbolic-ref`` (past 3.0s), the snippet
    verdict's walk (past 10s), the integrity guardian's ``git status`` — all
    on 2026-09-16, load 34 on 18 cores. Seventy-nine call sites carry such a
    budget. The budget now bounds the child's CPU time, and how long its CPU
    may go without advancing; a starved child is neither over budget nor
    wedged. Everything else is ``subprocess.run``: the same arguments, the
    same ``CompletedProcess``, ``TimeoutExpired`` when the bound is hit (its
    message says which bound), ``CalledProcessError`` under ``check``. A
    child whose CPU cannot be read is bounded by the wall clock, as before.
