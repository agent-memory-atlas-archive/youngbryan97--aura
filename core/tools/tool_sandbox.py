"""core/tools/tool_sandbox.py — the static screen for forged tool code.

What this can say is limited to what reading can decide: whether the code
parses, and whether it reaches for a module, call or attribute the shared
safety analyzer refuses. That is defense in depth, not containment. The
containment is where the code runs: ``ToolRegistry.execute_tool`` hands it
to ``run_untrusted``, which requires a kernel boundary and refuses to run
without one.

This used to report ``safe: True`` for anything that avoided five import
names, so ``import os.path``, ``__import__("os")``, ``open()`` and ``eval``
all passed — and its only caller ignored the verdict anyway. It reads the
same analyzer the symbolic sandbox uses now, and says only what it checked.
