"""How wide her view is, measured by turning all the way round.

She can measure how far the picture slides for a given mouse travel, which
tells her nothing about degrees: a slide is in pixels and a bearing is in
degrees, and nothing in a frame says how many degrees a pixel is worth.

One landmark settles it. Turning steadily, the picture slides by a measured
amount each time, and something named on screen crosses the middle of the
view, goes round the room and crosses it again. Between those two crossings
she has turned once: three hundred and sixty degrees over the slide between
them is how many degrees a pixel is worth, and the frame's own width in
pixels is then the field of view.

The frames themselves cannot answer it. Turning in steps of whole mouse
points does not land back on the starting heading — measured here, 18.09
degrees a step, so a revolution takes 19.9 of them and the view never
repeats. A landmark's crossing is continuous and can be interpolated between
two looks, which is what makes the count exact.

It matters for aiming at something that moves. A thing crossing her view is
caught by heading for where it is going, and the lead is an angle: how far
round the room it will have gone by the time she arrives. Measured 2026-09-26
without this, leading by a drift in pixels aimed past the edge of the view
and she lost the thing — chasing fell from 20 of 30 to 11. The lead needs a
field of view, so the field of view is measured.

Nothing here knows the world. The return is recognised by the picture, the
revolution is counted in her own turns, and a world whose walls repeat or
whose view never comes back reports nothing rather than a guess.
