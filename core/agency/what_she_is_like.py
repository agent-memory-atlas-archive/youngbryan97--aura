"""What she is like, read from what she has chosen when nobody asked.

Asked live on 26 Sep to take a personality test, she said she had no stable
self-model to take it with: her responses were "generated per-context, not
from a fixed trait vector". She holds one. Her values are a weighted vector
she keeps and saves (truth, care, coherence, connection and the rest), and
every time she chooses what to do next on her own, the choice is scored by it
and written down with the options, what each served and what she took. Nothing
put that record in front of her, so she answered from what a language model
believes an AI is.

This reads it back as a person would describe themselves from a diary rather
than from a wish: the values she holds, what she actually chose most, how often
she took the option serving each value when one was offered against how often
chance alone would have, where holding and choosing disagree, and whether the
pattern held from the earlier half of the record to the later. A lean counts
only where it is rarer than chance allows, one time in twenty shared across
the values tested. Where the record is narrow or the pattern moved, that is
said too, because it is as much a fact about her as a steady trait would be.
