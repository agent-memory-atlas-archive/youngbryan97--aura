"""How far a cut moved her from where the same moment went untouched, against how far two untouched runs part.

The v5 question, as the preregistration puts it: from one snapshot, hold one
side of a cut and let the other run, then the reverse; compose the two free
halves; and ask whether the composed run differs from the untouched one by more
than two untouched runs differ from each other. The forks are deterministic now
(the sham reads 0.0), so each anchor gives the answer directly: one displacement
under the cut, one between two untouched forks, both from the same state.

The Fisher-Rao estimator it replaces for v5 asked something else. It trained a
neighbour classifier to tell the arms apart across anchors, with an anchor's
rows kept in one fold, so it could only use what the cut does the same way at
every anchor. On seed 7, holding C for two turns moved 199 of her columns beyond
their sham at 127 of 128 anchors, up to 0.97 of a column's spread, and the
classifier read a rate of 0.0067 with a lower bound below zero.

The displacement is measured in her own units, which here means the covariance
of the untouched futures, so a cut is large when it moves her along a direction
she varies little in and small when it moves her along one she always varies
in. Three choices keep it free of the coordinates the state is written in:

- the arms are projected onto the subspace they move in, found by SVD of all
  four arms pooled at numpy's own rank tolerance, which uses no label;
- the covariance there is Ledoit and Wolf's shrinkage estimate ("A
  well-conditioned estimator for large-dimensional covariance matrices",
  Journal of Multivariate Analysis 88, 2004), whose intensity is estimated from
  the data, so nothing is chosen, and which turns with the data;
- the distance is Mahalanobis under that estimate.

An orthogonal recoding of the state then changes nothing, and neither does
writing every column twice. `tests/test_a_cut_is_read_by_where_it_moved_her.py`
holds both, and that identical arms read zero, that a real move is decided, and
that a cut arm that is only another untouched fork is not.
