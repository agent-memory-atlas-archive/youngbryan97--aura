"""Information that exists only in the combination.

Two sources can carry the same thing about a target, or different things, or
something neither carries alone. The last is synergy, and it is the one that
distinguishes a state whose parts are read together from a state whose parts
are read separately and added up.

The decomposition used is the minimum-information one: redundancy is the
smaller of the two single-source informations, which for jointly Gaussian
variables is the standard choice and has the advantage of being computable in
closed form from a covariance matrix rather than estimated from a histogram
nobody has enough samples to fill.

    Syn = I(X1,X2;Y) - I(X1;Y) - I(X2;Y) + min(I(X1;Y), I(X2;Y))

Each domain is reduced to a few principal components first. Forty columns
against a few thousand rows makes a covariance matrix that is nearly singular,
and a determinant near zero can report any amount of information at all.

Each component is then carried to a standard normal by its rank, the Gaussian
copula, so the estimate reads how the columns depend on each other and not the
shape of any one of them. The mutual information is the closed-form Gaussian
one with its sample-size bias taken off analytically, which holds no rows out
and so never scores one stretch of a drifting life against a model of another.

Because a positive number here would be easy to produce by accident, the same
computation runs against a null built by sliding the two sources together in
time against the target. The shift keeps every marginal, every autocorrelation and every
within-source relationship, and destroys only the alignment that synergy is
supposed to be about.

The linear estimator cannot see an interaction, so a second measurement asks
the question a different way: does adding the products of the two sources'
components improve held-out prediction over the two sources side by side? That
one is model-based and coarse, and it is here because it fails differently
from the Gaussian estimate, so agreement between them means more than either.
