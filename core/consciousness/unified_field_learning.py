Hebbian plasticity between turns, and what a turn was worth taught to the

CALL time: that module imports this one to build the class, and a test that

        `modulator` is the turn's worth as her chemistry got it: its sign, and
        its size against her recent turns, in [-1, 1]. Each connection moves
        by the modulator times what it did over the turn, at `hebbian_rate`,
        the rate her unconditioned learning already runs at, so a turn's payoff
        can move a connection as far as a turn of co-activity does. The
        connection keeps the trace for the whole turn and is judged when the
        turn ends: a three-factor rule (Fremaux and Gerstner 2016).

        Each unit's input weights are then scaled back to the strength it was
        born with, as synaptic scaling keeps a neuron's total drive (Turrigiano
        2008). A source that was active before payoffs takes a larger share of
        the units it drives from the sources that were not, and one active
        before detriments gives its share up. The traces start again either
        way, a neutral turn included. Returns each source's share of the
        field's input after the lesson.
