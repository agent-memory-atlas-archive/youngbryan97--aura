"""A hold is judged by progress, not by the clock.

LIVE, 2026-09-21: twenty-nine of these in one evening.

    🚨 DEADLOCK ALERT: Lock 'AuraKernel.StateLock' (ID: b78f35cc) held for 438.8s!
    StabilityGuardian: DEGRADED — lock_watchdog:1 active lock(s)

The lock was not deadlocked. `AuraKernel.tick` takes it, runs the phases,
and releases it in a `finally`; one of those phases was a generation on the
Brainstem, which on a loaded host takes minutes. Every alert was a CRITICAL
line, a degraded event at critical severity, and a DEGRADED card — and each
one was also eligible to fire a recovery callback that force-releases the
lock out from under live work.

The hold is real and worth knowing about. It is not a deadlock. This is the
same reading the cognitive engine renews its cycle from and the stall
watchdog uses for its starvation carve-out; the lock watchdog is the fourth
caller and the first that could have force-released something.
