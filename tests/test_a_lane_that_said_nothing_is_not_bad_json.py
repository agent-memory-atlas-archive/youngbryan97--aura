"""A lane that answered nothing is not a lane that answered badly.

On the reports ground of 29 September the deep-inference phase failed 148 times
against 10 successes, and every one was reported as "inference output did not
contain a JSON object". The log beside it said the fast lane had returned no
text and that its circuit was open: the message named the model's JSON while the
fault was that nothing had been asked to produce any.

The phase asks a fast lane every turn, so a lane that is down fails it every
turn for one reason. 148 identical degradations bury the one that is new.
