"""The text the person receives is the text that has to be verified.

CTX2-AMP-002: "Re-verification must operate on the delivered answer rather
than a hidden precursor that can diverge after rewriting." The amplifier
verified `answer`, then the calibration gate could rewrite it into
`calibrated_answer`, and the rewrite went out with `verified=True` from the
check its precursor passed. The durable sinks already kept the precursor —
CP126 d45893c2 fixed that half — so a wrong rewrite could not become cached
truth, but it could still be handed to a person as verified.
