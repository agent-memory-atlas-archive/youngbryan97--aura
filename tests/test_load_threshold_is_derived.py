"""The load requirement must come from the model, not from a constant.

Measured 2026-07-25 on the live host: the resident 32B is **17.2GB on disk**
and the flat gate demanded **24.0GB available** — a 6.8GB margin over true
need. The host sits around 20.4GB available with the fallback ladder resident,
so the cortex was refused a load it could have completed, and starved through
six deaths in a single run.

A constant cannot be right for every model. Weights × 1.20 + 1GB covers KV
cache and activations for a normal context with room to spare, and the flat
default stays the CEILING so this can only relax toward the real footprint —
never tighten past a deliberate operator setting.
