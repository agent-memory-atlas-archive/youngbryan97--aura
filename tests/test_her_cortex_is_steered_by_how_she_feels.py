"""The steering hooks read her felt state, not one neuron that is a term of it.

`HomeostaticCoupling` calls the continuous substrate the ground truth for her
felt state and blends it into affect at `SUBSTRATE_SHARE`; the affect phase
pushes the fused result back down once per turn. The channel that carries her
state to the hooks in her cortex published the raw neuron, and the neuron's own
dynamics are wider within a turn than anything the appraisal puts into it.

Measured on the stub organism, 28 September: three arms whose fused valence was
+0.456, +0.143 and +0.428 published neuron activations of 0.6154, 0.6077 and
0.6122 — the manipulation reached the hooks at eight thousandths of the spread
it had in her.
