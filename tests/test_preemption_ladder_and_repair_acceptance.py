"""Ask before killing; and don't take a step that delivered nothing.

Two applications of the same optimizer discipline.

**The preemption ladder.** ``soft_cancel_active_generation`` documents itself
as "the cheap first rung on the preemption ladder before
``force_abort_active_generation``", and roughly ten call sites use it that way.
The foreground first-token watchdog did not: it went straight to the kill,
which costs a ~60-90s reload of a 20GB resident model. A first-token overrun
has two causes that look identical from outside — a worker wedged in prefill,
which cannot poll the cancel word and must be killed, and a worker one decode
step from its first token, which observes the cancel immediately. Only the
first needs a reload, and telling them apart costs one bounded wait.

It also aborted without ``expected_request_id`` despite having just checked
that id, so a new foreground request starting in the window between the check
and the kill was the one that died.

**Trust-region acceptance.** Gauss-Newton, Levenberg-Marquardt and Dogleg all
compute the reduction a step PREDICTS, measure the reduction it DELIVERS, and
reject the step when the ratio is poor — they do not move merely because a step
was computed. ``repair_is_an_improvement`` checked "introduces no new
objection" and "is not much shorter" but never that the objection the repair
was invoked for was actually gone.
