"""The RLC has to be on the phase that actually answers.

There are two substantial response architectures — ``ResponseGenerationPhase``
(legacy pipeline) and ``UnitaryResponsePhase`` (the sovereign kernel path) —
and for a while the complete foreground RLC route lived only on the legacy
one while the kernel path jumped straight to ``llm.think``. An external audit
read the legacy integration, found it beautiful, and concluded the RLC served
ordinary chat. It did not.

CP070 fixed it. These tests exist so it cannot quietly revert: a capability
on a phase that does not run is the same defect as a capability with no
caller, and it is harder to see because the code is right there.
