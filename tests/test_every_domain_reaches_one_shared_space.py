"""Her domains reached each other through named channels a few numbers wide.

Affect wrote valence, arousal and curiosity; motivation wrote two budgets;
chemistry wrote a mood; the intention band at offset 68 carried three scalars.
Outside those bands the substrate's five hundred and twelve neurons were driven
only by the mesh. A cut that takes a domain away loses three or four numbers, so
it is cheap; and two channels that never meet cannot carry anything jointly.

A thalamus is what biology reached for: overlapping projections into one
high-dimensional space that every region reads back out of. `all_to_all` in the
null suite is the degenerate version — one shared signal, effective dimension
1.38, bound and empty — and a relay with per-domain projections is bound and
rich at once.
