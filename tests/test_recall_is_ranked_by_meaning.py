"""A question about what was said is answered from the memory closest in meaning.

Until 30 September the direct recall answer ranked remembered sentences by the
words they shared with the question, plus a length bonus that let almost any
sentence clear the bar, so it quoted whichever memory scored top. On twelve
question-and-memory pairs that was the right memory once. Ranked by meaning it
was the right memory eleven times, and a quote without the model now also
needs one of the question's own words to point at it.
