"""An arm that did not move the state her cortex reads cannot be a report of it.

The first three reports checks on seed 7 each moved her computed valence across
arms and read 0 of 24 anchors. None of them recorded what the steering hooks
were given, and the hooks were given 0.593 in every arm: the channel published
the substrate's valence neuron and an appraisal reached that neuron at eight
thousandths (7d60873f1). The run now records the valence activation per arm and
says whether the displacement arrived, at the bar the addendum of 28 September
fixed.
