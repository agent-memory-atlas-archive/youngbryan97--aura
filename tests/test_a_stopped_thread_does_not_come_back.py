"""A thread owner's stop() has to leave the thread stopped.

Found by sweeping for the shape of the experience-store leak (a close that
returned while its flusher still held the database): five classes stopped a
background thread and did not wait for it, and two of them could not stop it
at all once restarted.

* SubstrateSyncThread and SubstrateInjectionThread looped on one shared
  ``_running`` flag. stop() set it False and a quick start() set it True
  again before the old loop looked, so the old thread never left.
* OntogenyCore.stop() saved its state while the maintenance pass that saves
  the same state might still be running, and OutcomeSweeper.stop() returned
  before a sweep in flight had written its resolutions.
* EmbeddingEngine.close() could be followed by a loader thread started
  before it, which loaded the encoder and took a lane lease on a closed engine.
