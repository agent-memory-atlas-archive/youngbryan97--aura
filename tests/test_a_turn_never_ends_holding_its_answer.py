"""A reply phase that leaves a turn empty serves the draft a gate suppressed.

Her runtime already names this defect: `answer_available_but_never_served`,
"turn ended holding a servable answer that was never shown to the person". It
named it eleven times on the reports run of 29 September, where 33 of 96 arms
recorded an empty reply while her cortex had answered every one. The thinking
loop has asked the turn ledger for its best surviving draft since July; the
phase that serves chat never did.
