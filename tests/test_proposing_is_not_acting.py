"""Agency pathways are asked what they want, and used to do it while answering.

Every registered pathway runs on every pulse, then arbitration picks one
winner. Several pathways changed the world during that evaluation: they spent
the shared skill cooldown, dispatched swarm shards, and claimed the dispatch in
their own message. A proposal that lost — or that the action gate blocked —
had already spent the cooldown that stops real work from spamming, so a losing
pathway suppressed a winning one for the next half hour, and a shard the
capacity gate refused still became a memory of work in flight.
