"""A factual question never consulted the encyclopedia sitting on disk.

LIVE, 2026-08-10. "Who was Grace Hopper and what specifically did she build?
... tell me where you got it." was answered from model weights and signed
"Source: Wikipedia". No tool ran on that turn. The corpus holds a Grace Hopper
page and returns it in ~13ms, so the attribution was generated to match what
the answer WOULD have come from if anything had looked.

Three separate faults, and only the first was known:

1. LANE, not question. The corpus was reachable only through
   assemble_cognitive_ingress, which runs on the latent lane. That turn took
   the fast path, which had no ingress, so whether she could consult an
   encyclopedia depended on which lane the turn was routed to.

2. THE QUERY. Reached at all, it was reached with the whole sentence. The
   store builds an FTS query from every word with AND semantics and falls back
   to any-term when nothing matches — which a natural question always does. So
   "Who was Grace Hopper and what specifically did she build?" fell through to
   the OR pass, where who/was/and/what/did outweigh the two words carrying the
   question, and the top three hits were "History of software", "Terminator:
   Dark Fate" and "Vassar College". Confident irrelevant retrieval is worse
   than none.

3. LATENCY. That any-term fallback over a 7M-page index is not cheap:
   "thanks, that helps" spent 3.0 SECONDS returning nothing, so a turn needing
   no reference at all was the slowest turn on the lane.

The gate is deliberately NOT a pattern over question shape. Gating on
who/what/when + is/was is the hard-coding that let "can you run code" reach
her instruments while "can you search the web" did not: it serves the examples
its author thought of. What decides here is whether a retrieved page is about
what was asked.
