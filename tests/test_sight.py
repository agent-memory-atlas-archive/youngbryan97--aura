"""Looking when asked, and not otherwise.

Two errors, and they are not symmetric. Missing a real request makes her
blind at the moment she was asked to see, which costs a repeat. Firing on a
remark turns the webcam on in the middle of a conversation that was not about
it — the single most alarming thing an assistant with a camera can do, and
the one that gets the camera permission revoked permanently.

So most of what follows is about the second kind, and the negative cases are
written to be *plausible*: sentences a person would really say near a machine
that is listening, not strawmen.
