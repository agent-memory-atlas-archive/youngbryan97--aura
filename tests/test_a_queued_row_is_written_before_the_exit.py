"""Rows queued for a writer thread reach disk before the process leaves.

The outcome ledger and the ontogeny authority ledger hand writes made on the
event loop to a daemon writer thread. Every exit path leaves through the
finalizer's `os._exit`, which does not wait for daemon threads, and nothing
flushed either queue first — so whatever was written in the last moments
before a shutdown was gone. Each registers its flush in the coordinator's
`memory_commit` phase the first time it starts a writer.
