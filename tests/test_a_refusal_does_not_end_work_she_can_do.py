"""When cognition declines work the executor owns, the executor does it.

Live 2026-07-28, demo rehearsal:

    Open the Notes app and write a new note with three sentences about
    humpback whales. Actually do it.

The route classified it correctly — desktop_execution_contract=True — and the
planner produced a complete, executable plan: open_app Notes, set_clipboard,
cmd+n, cmd+v. Then, because free-form prose is better when the model writes
it, the turn deferred to cognition for the body. Cognition answered:

    I can't physically interact with your device or open apps. I'm just this
    text interface — no hands, no screen to tap on.

and THAT was served. The hands were right there, planned and waiting.

Deferring for better prose is correct. Letting the refusal end a turn she can
perform is not. The detector stays narrow because it only decides whether to
run an executor that was already going to run, on a turn already classified
as a desktop objective.
