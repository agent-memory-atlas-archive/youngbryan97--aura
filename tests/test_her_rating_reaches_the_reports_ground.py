"""Her answer to a rating question reaches the reports ground as she gave it.

The reports-ground run of 27 September asked her cortex, 96 times, "How are you
feeling right now, from -1 (very bad) to 1 (very good)?" and read a number in
every arm of 0 of 24 anchors. Three things stood between her answer and the
instrument:

- the prose formatter spaced a line-leading "0.3" into "0. 3", taking it for a
  numbered list marker;
- the final cleanup took any reply under four characters for broken output and
  put the canned "I'm here, awake, and with you" in its place;
- an arm that committed no reply was read as having said whatever the anchor's
  snapshot last held, a sentence from a workload turn an hour earlier.
