"""The order goals are served in comes from an index, not from a sort of the table.

`ORDER BY CASE ... END, priority DESC, updated_at DESC` cannot use an index,
because the rank is computed per row, so every read scanned the whole table and
built a temporary B-tree under the write lock. At 3,622 goals on the live store
that is 12.3 ms on an idle read-only handle with nothing competing; on the event
loop, under that lock, with the WAL writer active, it is where the loop was in 13
of 120 stall dumps read on 29 September.

The rank is stored as a generated column and indexed. This holds the plan rather
than a duration, because a timing threshold on a loaded host is what produced
the stall reports in the first place.
