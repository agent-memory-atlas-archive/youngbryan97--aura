# docs/

This folder contains 102 documentation files. Here is an overview of what you will find here.

If you need to check *whether a document is up to date*, see [DOC_STATUS.md](DOC_STATUS.md). It categorizes files into current docs, historical records, auto-generated files, and standards. Check there first if something looks unexpected.

## The claim surface

This section tracks project claims and verification standards to keep evaluations honest.

| | |
|---|---|
| [REALITY_REACH.md](REALITY_REACH.md) | Real-world physical interaction claims: hardware contracts, proofs of reachability, and test records. Read "Current Evidence" before accepting any physical claim |
| [CLAIM_BOUNDARIES.md](CLAIM_BOUNDARIES.md) · [CLAIM_SURFACE.md](CLAIM_SURFACE.md) | What the project claims to do and what falls outside its scope |
| [ABLATION_LEGIBILITY.md](ABLATION_LEGIBILITY.md) | Ablation tests (running with components disabled) showing measured performance changes — including cases with no difference |
| [BEHAVIORAL_PROOF_STANDARD.md](BEHAVIORAL_PROOF_STANDARD.md) | Evidence required to claim autonomous behavior or novel model output |
| `*_STANDARD.md` (11 files) | Evidence standards for each capability area. These remain fixed and only update when standards change, not when code changes |

## Research programmes

Long-running research initiatives and their progress records.

- **Recursive latent cortex** — the core model research track. Start with
  [RECURSIVE_LATENT_CORTEX.md](RECURSIVE_LATENT_CORTEX.md), the overview page
  explaining the research milestones. Supporting documents include:

  [SPARK_PRETRAINING_LEGS.md](SPARK_PRETRAINING_LEGS.md).
- **Language substrate and generality** — research on how the system forms,
  represents, and combines new concepts.
  [LANGUAGE_SUBSTRATE_AND_GENERALITY.md](LANGUAGE_SUBSTRATE_AND_GENERALITY.md)
  is the main overview; related files include
  [GENERALITY_ANALYSIS.md](GENERALITY_ANALYSIS.md) (problem breakdown and literature review),
  [GENERALITY_TODO.md](GENERALITY_TODO.md) (the development backlog),
  [ENDOGENOUS_LANGUAGE_PATHWAY.md](ENDOGENOUS_LANGUAGE_PATHWAY.md) (turning internal states into language),
  [FRONTIER_GENERAL_ARC.md](FRONTIER_GENERAL_ARC.md) (generalization goals), and

  [INNER_LIGHT_TEST.md](INNER_LIGHT_TEST.md), and
  [GHOST_SUBSTRATE.md](GHOST_SUBSTRATE.md).
- **Autonomy and self-modification** — safety boundaries and mechanisms for self-directed operation:

  [RSI_VALIDATION.md](RSI_VALIDATION.md), and
  [RSI_ARCHITECTURE.md](RSI_ARCHITECTURE.md).
- **Subsystem deep dives** —
  [MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md](MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md) (architecture of the 116-module memory system), and
  [REASONING_ENGINES.md](REASONING_ENGINES.md) (rule-based reasoning, sandboxed code execution, and operations kept outside the neural network).
- **Capability maps** — evaluations of capabilities against benchmarks and external frameworks:
  [OMEGA_CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md](OMEGA_CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md),
  [FICTIONAL_AI_CAPABILITY_MAP.md](FICTIONAL_AI_CAPABILITY_MAP.md),
  [FLIGHT_RECORDER.md](FLIGHT_RECORDER.md), and
  [DELIBERATE_PRACTICE.md](DELIBERATE_PRACTICE.md).

## Records

`evidence/` and all files with a date in their filename are historical snapshots. Each includes a header marking it as an archive. **These records are preserved as originally recorded** — for example, an evaluation verdict from July is not altered in August.

## Generated — do not hand-edit

Four files here are rendered from code. A manual edit survives until the
next build and then vanishes.

```bash
make architecture-map                          # ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md
make fmea-doc                                  # FMEA.md
make contract-doc                              # RUNTIME_CONTRACT.md
python tools/reqproof/progress.py              # AURA_PROGRESS.md
```

Check for drift without rewriting:

```bash
python tools/render_fmea.py --check
python tools/render_health_contract.py --check
```
