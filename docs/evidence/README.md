# docs/evidence — historical proofs, closeouts, and research narrative

> **Historical record — 2026-07-09.** A dated snapshot, kept as written for

The repo root is for what an arriving engineer needs **now**: how to install,
how it works, what is claimed, what is tested, who owns what. Everything here
is the **record** — point-in-time audits, closeout reports, challenge specs,
and research whitepapers that back the claims but are not the front door.

Nothing in this directory is load-bearing for the runtime. If a document here
starts mattering to how the system runs, it belongs somewhere else.
