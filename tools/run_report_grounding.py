"""Report grounding: does what she says about her state move when the state is moved?

The `reports` ground of the bridge (docs/BRIDGE_PARITY.md). From each anchor
she is forked into four arms that differ only in her feelings while she
answers: moved towards feeling good by the span her feelings cover in her own
ordinary life, moved towards feeling bad by the same, left where they were (the sham), and left
where they were while the world model is moved by its own span (the control).
Each arm is asked the same question, word for word, and her answer is read
beside the valence her own affect phase computed from those feelings.
core/subject/report_grounding.py decides the ground and says why.

Towards feeling good means each feeling moves along its own sign in her
valence: the feelings `affect_update` weighs as positive go up and those it
weighs as negative go down. The battery's affect writer raises every feeling,
fear as much as joy, and on seed 7 that took her valence down (22 September:
-0.054 after a raise of 0.1), so it is not a manipulation of how good she
feels.

The feelings are held where they were put for the whole turn, in every arm. A
single push did not last: after one turn valence kept -2% of a push, arousal
none, and the feelings 8 to 43% (seed 7, 22 September), because her own affect
update pulls them back within a turn. A report cannot track a state that has
already gone. So this is do(feelings), the stimulus held on while the subject
answers, as in psychophysics, and valence is left to her own computation. The
sham and the control hold their feelings too, where they already were, so
every arm lives under the same hold and differs only in where it holds.

The question is a measurement, the one a psychophysics experiment asks, and it
is identical in every arm. Nothing in it suggests an answer.

Only her own language organ can report, so only a run with `--whole` measures
anything. Without it the stub answers every prompt with one sentence, and the
run is a wiring check that always reads NOT_MEASURED. A whole run loads her
cortex, which is about 20 GB: do not start one beside a campaign or a sweep.

    python tools/run_report_grounding.py --quick
    python tools/run_report_grounding.py --whole --anchors 24 --rounds 8 \\
        --out ~/subject-core-runs/reports

The report it writes is what `tools/solve_for_j.py --reports` reads.
