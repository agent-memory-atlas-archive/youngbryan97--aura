#: The organs. Everything the running Aura does with a child process goes

#: source label, the accelerator claim, the shutdown interlock and the
#: read-only assertion. A direct spawn in here has none of that.
#:
#: Outside these roots — tests, tools, scripts, the launcher — spawning child
#: processes IS the job: a containment proof needs a real child to kill, an

#: sentinels must outlive the runtime they watch. This replaced a
#: ninety-entry file-name allowlist, most of whose entries no longer had a
#: subprocess call in them at all; the ones that did were tools and tests.
